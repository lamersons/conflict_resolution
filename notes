1. Assuming that master is always up-to-date or behind other branches
2. People should strongly avoid working and committing the same file as it creates extreme conflict cases.
In case of such a conflict the resolution will keep the origin/branch files and DELETE local, be sure to stash.




if origin/master ahead of master:
# to reset local master to origin/master and throws away any local unstaged files
git reset --hard origin/master


if temp branch:
master is ahead of dev   - rebase
master is untouched  -  ff merge


if well-know branch:





must not unclude feature branches into histoly log

git fetch --all
